In my Capstone Project for the IBM Data Analyst Certificaion, I analyzed several datasets to help identify trends for emerging technologies and presented my results through visualizations and storytelling. I first collected data for the technology skills that are in demand from various sources including job postings, blog posts, and surveys. Then I performed data wrangling by cleaning duplicated and missing data. Third, I applied statistical techniques to analyze the data and identify insights and trends to answer questions such as: What are the top programming languages that are in demand? What are the top database skills that are in demand? What are the most popular IDEs? What are some insights from demographic data like gender and age distribution of developers? Next, I created data visualizations including charts, graphs, and plots. Then, I created interactive dashboards using IBM Cognos to analyze and present the data dynamically. Finally, I provided a narrative and presented the findings of my analysis through a power point presentation.
